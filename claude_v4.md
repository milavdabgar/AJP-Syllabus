## Competency-focused Outcome-based Green Curriculum-2021 (COGC-2021)
### Semester-V
### Course Title: Advanced Java Programming
Diploma programme in which this course is offered: Information and Communication Technology
Semester in which offered: Fifth

## 1. RATIONALE
This course builds upon the foundational Java programming concepts and equips students with advanced skills and knowledge to develop robust and scalable applications. It covers essential topics such as GUI development, database connectivity, web development using Java technologies, and the application of design patterns. The course emphasizes practical application of these concepts through hands-on projects and exercises, preparing students for industry challenges and enabling them to stay abreast of the latest trends in Java development.

## 2. COMPETENCY
The aim of this course is to help students attain the following industry-identified competency through various teaching-learning experiences:
- Develop efficient and scalable applications using advanced Java concepts and techniques.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
Students will develop the following course outcomes (COs) through practical exercises, underpinning knowledge, and relevant soft skills associated with the competency:

a) Build Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications using Java Swing.
b) Implement database operations using JDBC and object-relational mapping (ORM) using Hibernate.
c) Develop web applications using Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP).
d) Explore Java web frameworks like Spring MVC for web application development.
e) Apply design patterns in Java application development.

## 4. TEACHING AND EXAMINATION SCHEME
Teaching Scheme (In Hours):
- Lectures: 3 hours per week
- Practical: 2 hours per week

Total Credits (L + P/2): 4

Examination Scheme:
- Theory:
    - Continuous Assessment (CA): 30 marks
    - End Semester Examination (ESE): 70 marks
- Practical:
    - Continuous Assessment (CA): 25 marks
    - End Semester Examination (ESE): 25 marks

Total Marks: 150

Note: Out of 30 marks under the theory CA, 10 marks are for the assessment of the micro-project to facilitate the integration of COs, and the remaining 20 marks are the average of 2 tests taken during the semester for assessing the attainment of the cognitive domain UOs required for the attainment of the COs.

## 5. SUGGESTED PRACTICAL EXERCISES
The following practical outcomes (PrOs) are the sub-components of the COs. These PrOs need to be attained to achieve the COs. The approximate number of hours required for each practical exercise is mentioned.

1. Implement a GUI application with menus, toolbars, and event handling using Java Swing components. (6 hours)
2. Create a Java application that connects to a database and performs CRUD operations using JDBC. (4 hours)
3. Develop a Hibernate application that maps Java objects to a database table and performs CRUD operations using ORM. (4 hours)
4. Create a simple Servlet that displays a welcome message when accessed. (2 hours)
5. Develop a web application using Servlets and JSP to handle user registration and login. (6 hours)
6. Implement a web application using the Spring MVC framework for CRUD operations on a database table. (6 hours)

Total hours: 28

Note: More practical exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to develop industry-relevant skills and outcomes to match the COs.

## 6. MAJOR EQUIPMENT/INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED
1. Computer systems with the latest configuration and appropriate operating systems (Windows, Linux, or macOS).
2. Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above.
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.
4. Apache Tomcat or any other web server for deploying web applications.
5. MySQL or any other relational database management system (RDBMS).

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES
The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in the above-mentioned COs and PrOs:

a) Motivation and attitude towards learning advanced Java concepts and techniques.
b) Effective communication and collaboration skills in team projects.
c) Ethical practices in software development and data handling.
d) Appreciation for sustainable and environmentally friendly software solutions.

The ADOs should be developed through laboratory/project-based exercises, and the level of achievement should gradually increase according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy' from 'Valuing Level' in the first year to 'Characterization Level' in the third year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY
