## 1. RATIONALE
This course provides students with advanced knowledge and skills in Java programming, enabling them to develop robust and scalable applications across various domains, including web, desktop, mobile, and enterprise. It covers advanced topics such as multithreading, advanced GUI development, database connectivity, and the application of design patterns. Additionally, the course introduces modern Java frameworks and libraries for web development, cloud computing, and microservices. By emphasizing both theoretical concepts and practical applications, students will be equipped to tackle complex software development challenges and stay abreast of the latest industry trends and best practices.

## 2. COMPETENCY
The aim of this course is to help students attain the following industry-identified competency through various teaching-learning experiences:
- Develop scalable and efficient applications using advanced Java concepts and industry-standard frameworks.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
Students will develop the following course outcomes (COs) through practical exercises, underpinning knowledge, and relevant soft skills associated with the competency:

a) Develop multithreaded applications using advanced concurrency concepts in Java.
b) Build advanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications using Java Swing and JavaFX.
c) Implement database operations and object-relational mapping (ORM) using JDBC and Hibernate.
