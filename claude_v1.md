# GUJARAT TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY (GTU)
## Competency-focused Outcome-based Green Curriculum-2021 (COGC-2021)
### Semester-V
### Course Title: Advanced Java Programming  
Diploma programme in which this course is offered: Information and Communication Technology  
Semester in which offered: Fifth

## 1. RATIONALE
This course provides comprehensive knowledge and skills necessary for developing dynamic and robust web applications using Java technologies. It covers advanced concepts and techniques in Java web development, including database connectivity, server-side programming, and application frameworks. Students will learn to build scalable and secure web applications using industry-standard tools and frameworks. The course emphasizes practical application of theoretical concepts through hands-on projects and exercises.

## 2. COMPETENCY
The aim of this course is to help students attain the following industry-identified competency through various teaching-learning experiences:
- Develop web applications using Java web frameworks and technologies.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
Students will develop the following course outcomes (COs) through practical exercises, underpinning knowledge, and relevant soft skills associated with the competency:

a) Develop GUI applications using Java Swing components.
b) Implement database operations using JDBC and Hibernate ORM framework.
c) Develop server-side programs using Servlets and JSP for web applications.
d) Apply the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture using Spring MVC framework.
e) Develop RESTful web services using Java technologies.

## 4. TEACHING AND EXAMINATION SCHEME
Teaching Scheme (In Hours):
- Lectures: 3 hours per week
- Practical: 2 hours per week

Total Credits (L + P/2): 4

Examination Scheme:
- Theory:
   - Continuous Assessment (CA): 30 marks
   - End Semester Examination (ESE): 70 marks
- Practical:
   - Continuous Assessment (CA): 25 marks
   - End Semester Examination (ESE): 25 marks

Total Marks: 150

Note: Out of 30 marks under the theory CA, 10 marks are for the assessment of the micro-project to facilitate the integration of COs, and the remaining 20 marks are the average of 2 tests taken during the semester for assessing the attainment of the cognitive domain UOs required for the attainment of the COs.

## 5. SUGGESTED PRACTICAL EXERCISES
The following practical outcomes (PrOs) are the sub-components of the COs. These PrOs need to be attained to achieve the COs:

1. Develop a GUI application using Swing components (e.g., JFrame, JButton, JTextField, JMenu).
2. Develop a program to connect to a database and perform CRUD operations using JDBC.
3. Develop a Hibernate application to map Java objects to a database table and perform CRUD operations.
4. Create a simple Servlet that displays a welcome message when accessed.
5. Develop a web application using Servlets and JSP to handle user registration and login.
6. Implement a web application using the Spring MVC framework for CRUD operations on a database table.
7. Develop a RESTful web service using Java technologies (e.g., JAX-RS) to expose CRUD operations for a resource.

Note: More practical exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to develop industry-relevant skills and outcomes to match the COs.

## 6. MAJOR EQUIPMENT/INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED
1. Computer systems with the latest configuration and appropriate operating systems (Windows, Linux, or macOS).
2. Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above.
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.
4. Apache Tomcat or any other web server for deploying web applications.
5. MySQL or any other relational database management system (RDBMS).

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES
The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in the above-mentioned COs and PrOs:

a) Motivation and attitude towards learning advanced Java web development.
b) Effective communication and collaboration skills in team projects.
c) Ethical practices in software development and data handling.
d) Appreciation for sustainable and environmentally friendly software solutions.

The ADOs should be developed through laboratory/project-based exercises, and the level of achievement should gradually increase according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy' from 'Valuing Level' in the first year to 'Characterization Level' in the third year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY
The major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level Unit Outcomes (UOs) of Revised Bloom's Taxonomy to facilitate the attainment of COs and the competency.
