## Prerequisite:

Successful completion of **Semester 3 â€“ Java Programming (DI03032021)** with foundational understanding of:

- Object-oriented programming concepts including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces
- Exception handling mechanisms and basic multithreading
- Collections framework (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap)
- File input/output operations and basic serialization

---

## Rationale:

This course transforms students from basic Java programmers into **full-stack web developers**. Building on the solid foundation from Semester 3, students learn to create modern, database-driven web applications using industry-standard technologies.

The course follows a **"learn by building" approach** where students create real web applications from day one. No complex theory - just practical coding that builds confidence and skills. Students incrementally develop a complete web application throughout the semester, learning database connectivity, server-side programming, dynamic web pages, and modern API development.

The emphasis is on **hands-on, practical development** that prepares diploma graduates for immediate employment as **Junior Full-Stack Java Developers**. By course completion, students will have built a complete, deployable web application that serves as an impressive portfolio piece for job interviews. This course provides the perfect stepping stone to advanced frameworks like Spring Boot and prepares students for real-world development roles.

**Why students will love this course:**
- Build real web applications, not just academic exercises
- Learn modern, job-ready skills employers want
- Create an impressive portfolio project
- No overwhelming theory - focus on practical coding
- Gain confidence in full-stack development
