The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U, and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES
Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, the following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct the following activities in groups and prepare small reports (of 1 to 5 pages for each activity). For the micro-project report, students should follow the suggested format. For other activities, students and teachers together can decide on the format of the report. Students should also collect/record physical evidence such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student's) portfolio, which will be useful for their placement interviews:

a) Undertake micro-projects in teams.
b) Explore different application development using Java web application technologies/tools and frameworks.
c) Prepare charts to explain the use/process of the identified topic.
d) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
e) Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edX, Coursera, Udemy, etc. to further enhance their learning.
f) https://java-iitd.vlabs.ac.in/ this website provides a virtual lab and gives simulations of Java programs.
g) https://www.codechef.com this website gives competitive programming problems; students are expected to solve examples and cross-check with the output.
h) Encourage students to form a coding club at the institute level and can help the slow learners.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
c) Encourage students to do Group learning by sharing so that teaching can easily be enhanced.
d) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
e) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
f) With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
g) Guide students for open source Java editors.
