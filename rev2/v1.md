**Program Name:** Engineering  
**Level:** Diploma  
**Branch:** Information & Communication Technology  
**Course / Subject Code:** [To be assigned]  
**Course / Subject Name:** Advanced Java Programming

---

## w. e. f. Academic Year: 2025-26

**Semester:** 4th  
**Category of the Course:** Elective/PCC

---

## Prerequisite:

Successful completion of **Semester 3 – Java Programming (DI03032021)** with foundational understanding of:

- Object-oriented programming concepts including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces
- Exception handling mechanisms and multithreading basics
- Collections framework (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, TreeMap)
- File input/output operations and object serialization

---

## Rationale:

This course advances students from core Java programming to enterprise web application development. Building upon the object-oriented foundation established in Semester 3, students learn to create production-ready, database-driven web applications using industry-standard technologies.

The course adopts a **project-driven pedagogical approach** where students incrementally build a complete web application throughout the semester. This methodology ensures deep understanding of how JDBC, Servlets, JSP, and REST APIs integrate to form modern web solutions. Students learn database connectivity, server-side programming, dynamic web page generation, and RESTful API development.

The emphasis is on hands-on, practical development that prepares diploma graduates for immediate employment in Java web development roles. By course completion, students will have built a complete, deployable web application that serves as a portfolio piece for job applications and interviews. This prepares them for entry-level Java developer positions and provides the necessary foundation for advanced frameworks like Spring Boot in higher studies or professional development.

## Suggested Activities for Students:

1. **Code Review Sessions:** Organize peer code review sessions where students present their servlet/JSP code and receive constructive feedback from classmates. This improves coding practices and helps students learn different problem-solving approaches.

2. **Mini Hackathons:** Conduct 4-hour coding challenges where students build specific features (e.g., authentication system, REST API endpoint) under time constraints. This encourages rapid problem-solving and practical application of concepts.

3. **Database Design Workshops:** Students work in groups to design normalized database schemas for real-world scenarios, then present and defend their designs. This reinforces database normalization and proper table relationships.

4. **API Testing Sessions:** Hands-on practice sessions using Postman to test REST endpoints, create test collections, and automate API testing. Students learn professional API testing practices used in industry.

5. **Security Audit Sessions:** Students review each other's code for security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, authentication flaws) and propose fixes. This builds security awareness and defensive programming practices.

6. **Debugging Challenges:** Present intentionally buggy servlet/JSP applications and have students identify and fix errors. This develops critical debugging skills and understanding of common pitfalls.

7. **Git Workflow Workshops:** Hands-on sessions teaching Git fundamentals, branching strategies, and collaborative development practices essential for professional development.

8. **Guest Lectures:** Invite industry professionals working with Java web technologies to share real-world experiences, current trends (Spring Boot, microservices), and career guidance.

9. **Project Showcase Event:** Organize end-of-semester showcase where students demonstrate their mini-projects to faculty, peers, and potentially industry guests. This builds presentation skills and professional confidence.

10. **Study Groups:** Facilitate formation of study groups where students collaborate on understanding complex topics like MVC architecture, session management, REST principles, and security best practices through peer teaching.
