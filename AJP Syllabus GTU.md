Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's Taxonomy)

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students in their learning and teachers in teaching and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions to assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U, and A) in the question paper may vary from the above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES
Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, the following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct the following activities in groups and prepare small reports of 1 to 5 pages for each activity. For the micro-project report, students should follow the suggested format. For other activities, students and teachers together can decide on the format of the report. Students should also collect/record physical evidence such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student's) portfolio, which will be useful for their placement interviews:

a) Undertake micro-projects in teams.
b) Develop a complete web application using Spring MVC and Hibernate.
c) Create a mobile application using Java and Android SDK.
d) Participate in coding competitions and hackathons related to Java programming.
e) Contribute to open-source Java projects on GitHub.
f) Attend seminars, workshops, and tech talks on advanced Java topics.
g) Prepare a comparative study of different Java web frameworks.
h) Develop a IoT project using Java and Raspberry Pi.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub-topics.
b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
c) Encourage students to contribute to open-source Java projects.
d) Ask students to study research papers on advanced Java topics and present their findings.
e) Invite industry experts to deliver guest lectures on latest trends in Java development.
f) Organize coding competitions and hackathons to foster a competitive learning environment.
g) Encourage students to participate in Java user groups and online forums.
h) Use flipped classroom approach for selected topics to promote self-learning.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total work load on each student due to the micro-project should be about 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours (i.e., about one hour per week) during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

1. Develop a web-based employee management system using Spring MVC, Hibernate, and MySQL.
2. Create an e-commerce application with shopping cart functionality using Java Servlets, JSP, and JDBC.
3. Implement a chat application using Java Sockets and Swing for the user interface.
4. Develop a weather monitoring system using Java, Raspberry Pi, and sensors.
5. Create a task management application using JavaFX and JPA for data persistence.
