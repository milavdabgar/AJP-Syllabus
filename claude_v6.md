- Develop proficiency in using Java libraries and frameworks for various application domains
- Implement design patterns to create maintainable, extensible, and efficient code
- Build web applications and RESTful APIs using Java technologies
- Gain exposure to enterprise-level frameworks like Spring and Hibernate
- Develop skills in concurrent programming, networking, and database integration

Prerequisites:
- Strong understanding of core Java programming concepts
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
