Got a partial response, the response was only till 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS but a few changes I want are: 
* subject to be offered in Semester 5 
* Define only 5 CO, one CO for each unit. 
* create a table for TEACHING AND EXAMINATION SCHEME 
* create a table for SUGGESTED PRACTICAL EXERCISES. with headers as per the table in pdf. 
* 8\. UNDERPINNING THEORY table should be in format as followed in pdf, just add hours column. 
* for 9. SUGGESTED SPECIFICATION TABLE FOR QUESTION PAPER DESIGN only columns till R level are visible, properly format the table. 
 
with all these changes please regenerate the full syllabus in markdown format.
