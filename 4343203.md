## Competency-focused Outcome-based Green Curriculum-2021 (COGC-2021)
### Semester-IV
### Course Title: Java Programming

Diploma programme in which this course is offered: Information and Communication Technology
Semester in which offered: Fourth  

## 1. RATIONALE
This course is designed to teach object-oriented programming concepts, techniques, and applications using the Java programming language. Object-oriented programming emphasizes the fundamentals of structured design with classes, including development, testing, implementation, and documentation. It also includes object-oriented programming techniques, classes, and objects. Java is a simple, portable, distributive, robust, secure, dynamic, architecture-neutral, object-oriented programming language. The Java programming language is designed to enable the development of small, reliable, portable, distributed, real-time operating platforms, and high-performance applications for the widest range of computing platforms possible, as well as cross-platform interaction. By making applications available across heterogeneous environments, businesses can provide more services, boost end-user productivity, communication, and collaboration to enterprise and consumer applications. The Java programming language originated as part of a research project to develop advanced software for a wide variety of network devices and embedded systems. The Java programming language is used as the teaching vehicle for this course.

The aim of this course is for students to learn platform-independent object-oriented programming and Java as the base language for advanced technologies like three-tier architecture applications, cloud computing, and web development. Java is also used to program electronic hardware devices such as air conditioners, televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, and many others.

## 2. COMPETENCY
The aim of this course is to help the students attain the following industry-identified competency through various teaching-learning experiences:
- Develop Java applications using an object-oriented approach.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge, and the relevant soft skills associated with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:  

a) Write simple Java programs for a given problem statement.
b) Use object-oriented programming concepts to solve real-world problems.
c) Develop an object-oriented program using inheritance and package concepts for a given problem statement.
d) Develop an object-oriented program using multithreading and exception handling for a given problem statement.
e) Develop an object-oriented program by using files and the collection framework.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES
Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, the following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct the following activities in groups and prepare small reports (of 1 to 5 pages for each activity). For the micro-project report, students should follow the suggested format. For other activities, students and teachers together can decide on the format of the report. Students should also collect/record physical evidence such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student's) portfolio, which will be useful for their placement interviews:

a) Undertake micro-projects in teams.
b) List different versions of Java and their new features.
c) Prepare charts to explain the use/process of the identified topic.
d) https://java-iitd.vlabs.ac.in/ this website provides a virtual lab and gives simulations of Java programs.
e) Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edX, Coursera, Udemy, etc. to further enhance their learning.
f) https://www.codechef.com this website gives competitive programming problems; students are expected to solve examples and cross-check with the output.
g) Encourage students to form a coding club at the institute level and can help the slow learners.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub-topics.
b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
c) Managing Learning Environment
d) Diagnosing Essential Missed Learning concepts that will help for students.
e) Guide Students to do Personalized learning so that students can understand the course material at his or her pace.
f) Encourage students to do Group learning by sharing so that teaching can easily be enhanced.
g) 'CI" in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
h) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
i) With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
j) Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the knowledge of this course.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total work load on each student due to the micro-project should be about 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours (i.e., about one hour per week) during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

1. Student Record Keeping System
2. Inventory Management System
3. Airline reservation system
4. Electricity billing system
5. Healthcare management system
6. Library management system
7. Bank management system
8. Medical management system
9. Quiz management system
10. Survey System
11. Stock management system
12. Tic Tac Toe Game
13. Chess Game
14. Battleship Console Game
