## Rationale:

This course advances students from core Java programming to enterprise web application development. Building upon the object-oriented foundation established in Semester 3, students learn to create production-ready, database-driven web applications using industry-standard technologies.

The course adopts a **project-driven pedagogical approach** where students incrementally build a complete web application throughout the semester. This methodology ensures comprehensive understanding of how JDBC, Servlets, JSP, and REST APIs integrate to form modern web solutions. Students develop proficiency in database connectivity, server-side programming, dynamic web page generation, and RESTful API development.

The emphasis is on practical application development that prepares diploma graduates for immediate employment in Java web development roles. By course completion, students will have developed a complete, deployable web application that serves as a portfolio demonstration for career opportunities. This course provides the necessary foundation for advanced frameworks and prepares students for professional Java development positions.
